## To-Do List Web Application
This repository contains both Manual and Automation testing assets for a sample To-Do List web application. It shows structured QA practices, covering test strategy, functional/UI/boundary test cases, bug reports, and Selenium-based test automation.

## Tools Used

### Manual Testing:
- **Excel word**: For writing test strategy, test cases, bug report.

### Automation Testing:
- **Java**: Programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Browser automation tool
- **TestNG**: Test execution and reporting framework
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management
- **WebDriverManager**: To auto-manage browser drivers

## Steps to Run Automation
1. Clone this repo https://github.com/NadaMahmoud16/Eyego-Technical-Assignment.git
2. Import into IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse as a Maven project.
3. Install dependencies (should auto-resolve via pom.xml).
4. Run tests.

## Assumptions Made
- The To-Do web application (e.g., Todoist) is publicly accessible.
- User have to log in.
- All tasks are executed in the Today tab of the app.
- DOM structure and element locators remain consistent.
- Internet connection is stable during test execution.
- Tests run in Chrome browser (default in WebDriverManager).
